# CDSRE
Cosmic DS ROM Editor, the spiritual successor to SDSME. This project aims to make gen IV ROM hacking as easy as possible,
with a robust tool that does most of the grunt work under the hood.

CDSRE is designed with Pt in mind, but DPHGSS are not out of the question, and support for gen V (i.e. BWB2W2) is also on
the table for the future
